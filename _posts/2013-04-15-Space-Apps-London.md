The NASA Space Apps Challenge, hosted by Google in London was an incredible event with a huge variety of software developers/ engineers and designers. 

The venue was as you would expect from Google, funky, strange and a little weird. A super-sized Lego head was a particular highlight. 

The team from Nottingham bagged our space early, and we dug in for the long hall. 

Working with horribly typed NASA data sets, we created an Android app to demonstrate the scale of the Voyager project. 

A midnight McDonalds trip, a Google hangout with an astronaut and a rant from Joe to NASA big wigs made this a very entertaining event!
