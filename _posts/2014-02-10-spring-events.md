title: Spring Schedule 2014.

We’re going to go with two types of event, and will alternate them every week.

### Week 1 – Casual Hack and Talks
We’ll be meeting somewhere (location tbc week before event) for an evening of hacking and talks. Lightning talk slots open for anyone brave. If you have a topic you want covered, suggest it and we’ll try to do so or find someone who can! The next one of these will be in the Hub, CS, Jubilee on the 13th, and will be our Hardware Hacking workshop, going over Arduino, Makey Makey, Pi and AR.Drone in detail.

### Week 2 – Beginners Java
This will run throughout the semester, and will take you from absolutely no experience, up to producing Android apps (we hope). The pace will be set by the attendees so everyone can follow along, and we hope to have you all hacking in no time! The first one of these will be on the 20th of February, in the Hub, CS, Jubilee.

So to summarise:

* 13th – Hardware talk,
* 20th – Beginners Java,
* 27th – Talk/Casual Hack
* 6th- Beginners Java continued.


AND SO ON INFINITUM
If a session isn’t on due to exams/other event/catastrophe/viral outbreak, we will notify everyone via email and Facebook.

Room locations and topics will be confirmed the week prior to an event.
For any questions, to request a topic or to volunteer to give a talk, please email mail@hacksocnotts.co.uk or comment on Facebook.
